▸ Drafts
1. Display of FTE as Fte - can we please display FTE as FTE? In fact all the places where we have defined something in upper case, then they should be displayed in upper case only. Other example is VAT
2. Can we please add the following additional fields for the below mentioned services in the jobs:
a. Aus - Compliance: Year - This should be dropdown of all the years starting with previous 5 years
b. Aus - Bookkeeping: Period - first we should give a drop down which should be Day, Week, Fortnight, Month, Quarter, Year, Other. Now depending on what the user has chosen, we should then display second field. For Day, it will just be one date. For Week, first show the year drop down, then month and in that month, then show the weeks drop down with dates so that there is no confusion. For Fortnight, same as week but fortnights as periods. For Month, show the year and then the months. For Quarter, show the year and then the quarters and then for the Year, show the years. For Other, show From and To dates
